    (a) Generate the plots of the degree distribution of the graphs g'B, g'D, and gwB.

    1.  Generate a visualization of the graph using Gephi that assigns a
        color to the nodes based on the community they belong to and sizes the nodes
        proportionally to their betweenness centrality. Use a layout algorithm that allows
        for easy identification of the communities. Show the names of the most important
        artists (highest betweenness centrality) in each community.

    2.  Generate a visualization of the graph using Gephi while maintaining the
        same node positioning as the previous exerciseâ€™s graph, but now assigning node size
        based on their number of followers and node color based on the distance of each
        node from the initial node of the crawler (the node representing the artist Drake).
        Highlight the two artists selected for the plot audio features comparison (the less
        and most similar artists to Drake).
